I am currently studying for a master's degree in computer science applied to business management at the University of Lille. I am a fan of new technologies and business management.
I already got my bachelor's degree from the same university last year. To allow me to concretize my training, I am looking for an internship and a work-study program for my second year of master.

Before arriving in France, I was doing a degree in computer engineering at the University of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Conakry.
Since my young age I have been attracted to IT and I also have a real desire for starting a business
